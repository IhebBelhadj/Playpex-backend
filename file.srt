1
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:33,250
<i>A long time ago,</i>
<i>it is said, a monster came here.</i>

2
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,291
There it is.

3
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,458
Sarii.

4
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,625
Circle back.

5
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,166
...the trial.

6
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,833
...my trial.

7
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,166
Fetch.

8
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,600
...orange flowers.

9
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,583
...orange flowers?

10
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,041
Crazy.

11
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,416
...orange flowers.

12
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,700
-What's going on?

13
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,416
Fetch.

14
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,375
Ouch. Ouch.

15
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,625
Hurry up!

16
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,041
I'm cold.

17
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,708
Stand still.

18
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,166
No.

19
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,125
Go!

20
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,208
Your trial.

21
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:11,333
Here.

22
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:15,916
Here!

23
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,500
...your trial...

24
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,750
Taabe comes! Taabe comes!

25
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,750
Come.

26
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:33,375
Come.

27
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:37,250
Come with me.

28
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,625
Now.

29
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:41,500
Buffalo spirit, fly well.

30
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:45,666
Thank you, Creator, for your life.

31
00:46:44,666 --> 00:46:47,166
-a monster.

32
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:31,666
That's bad.

33
00:55:20,625 --> 00:55:23,833
Look Here.

34
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,166
Look Here.

35
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,500
A woman?

36
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,375
What is she doing here?

37
00:55:34,166 --> 00:55:35,958
I will carry her.

38
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,500
She's gonna slow us down

39
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:41,333
No.
By the way she was running,
I think she saw it.

40
00:56:01,166 --> 00:56:03,833
That's your new blonde, huh?

41
00:56:49,541 --> 00:56:51,625
Get that fucking dog off me!

42
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:57,125
I don't have a good feeling about this.

43
00:57:43,833 --> 00:57:47,791
Are you Angry?
Now you will pay.

44
00:57:47,875 --> 00:57:49,541
We'll see what she knows

45
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:53,041
-Speak, dirty Raphael.
-What are you doing here, huh?

46
00:57:53,125 --> 00:57:55,666
-It's a trap ?
-What is happening?

47
00:58:13,541 --> 00:58:17,125
I'm going to kill her.

48
00:58:17,208 --> 00:58:19,125
We can always use her.

49
00:58:42,083 --> 00:58:44,083
I will make her sing.

50
00:58:52,125 --> 00:58:56,458
Bring out the savage.
Get him out of the damn box!

51
00:59:01,791 --> 00:59:06,208
One way or another,
you're going to help us.

52
00:59:08,125 --> 00:59:10,750
Make it bleed.

53
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:49,125
We shouldn't have brought the horses.

54
00:59:50,125 --> 00:59:52,833
Shut them up or the beast won't come.

55
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:10,916
...your trial?

56
01:00:16,458 --> 01:00:19,500
Where is this whore beast?

57
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:22,416
I'm hungry and I need to pee.

58
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:31,916
What is happening?

59
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,375
Oh, no, no, no.
What is happening?

60
01:00:34,458 --> 01:00:37,416
What is happening?
What is happening? Rambert!

61
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,000
Shoot, Rambert!

62
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:47,958
Shit.

63
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:07,583
He's there!

64
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:13,000
He's there!

65
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,750
That is some crazy shit.

66
01:03:09,625 --> 01:03:12,416
Now!

67
01:03:24,291 --> 01:03:26,208
We have it!

68
01:03:50,708 --> 01:03:52,166
Bastard!

69
01:05:38,875 --> 01:05:40,625
Shoot!

70
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:42,083
We will hit the others!

71
01:05:42,166 --> 01:05:44,875
Shoot!

72
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:24,083
Spread. Get away!

73
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:59,375
Let's hurry a little.

74
01:07:59,458 --> 01:08:00,500
I need help.

75
01:08:00,583 --> 01:08:04,041
We can't do anything for them.
We just have to keep moving forward.

76
01:08:04,125 --> 01:08:05,333
And the dog?

77
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,041
I love the dog.

78
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:10,166
It tastes better than beaver.

79
01:09:23,208 --> 01:09:24,791
Go find Taabe.

80
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:04,625
Cheater!

81
01:20:40,916 --> 01:20:44,833
Nope! Oh no! No stop!

82
01:20:44,916 --> 01:20:46,083
Whore!

83
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,625
Idiot savage.

84
01:21:24,875 --> 01:21:28,958
You don't even know
the mistake you just made.

85
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:35,208
I will put a bullet in your skull.

86
01:21:38,458 --> 01:21:42,583
You're gonna die, bitch!

87
01:22:34,875 --> 01:22:35,916
Demon!

88
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:39,083
No!

89
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,458
Fetch!

90
01:28:14,416 --> 01:28:15,958
Naru is coming here!

91
01:28:19,375 --> 01:28:22,791
Arüka, here! Arüka, Naru comes.

92
01:28:22,875 --> 01:28:24,291
Naru comes.

93
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,791
What does she have?

94
01:28:33,833 --> 01:28:35,208
What does she have?
